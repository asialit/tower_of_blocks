# tower_of_blocks

Univerity project.
Create a tower of blocks (strings) using Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorith and Dijkstra's algorithm.
Tower should be as low as possible.

Input:
first line - number of blocks
second line - a block from which we start
third line - a block on which we finish
rest of lines - rest of blocks

Output - height of the tower 

Example:
Input:
5
paabaac
aadaabz
aacaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
aacaaeaae
aaeaaeaad

Output:
20
